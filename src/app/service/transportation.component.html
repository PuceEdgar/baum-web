				<h1>New Car</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>There are over 200 chemical compounds found in vehicles. Since these chemicals are not regulated, consumers have no way of knowing the dangers they face. Benzene, toluene, formaldehyde, and heavy metals are all part of the mix. Immediate symptoms can range from a sore throat to headaches, dizziness, allergic reactions and nausea, depending on the sensitivity of an individual. Continued exposure to some of these can lead to hormonal disruption, reproductive impacts and damage to the liver, kidneys and central nervous system â€” or even cancer. Our phytonchide product can eliminate most of these bad chemicals, thus protect your health condition.</p>
